# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In the projects for this course, I was tasked with creating a course management system that could efficiently handle and organize course data, including course prerequisites, by using appropriate data structures. The primary goal was to design a system that allowed users to load course data from a file, search for specific courses, and display course information in a user-friendly manner.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by first analyzing the requirements and considering which data structures would best suit the needs of the project. Understanding data structures is crucial because they determine how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated in a program. For this project, I chose a binary search tree for storing course information due to its efficient lookup and insertion capabilities.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I encountered several challenges, particularly with implementing the binary search tree in the final project. Luckely throughout the course, we had to create pseudocodes to visualize the logic and ensure that we had a clear plan for implementation for the final project. This kept me organized and allowed me to finish the project efficiently. 

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project significantly broadened my approach to software design and development. It reinforced the importance of choosing the right data structure based on the specific needs of the application. I learned to take a more analytical approach, considering the efficiency and scalability of my solutions. Additionally, the project emphasized the value of thorough planning before diving into coding, which is something I will carry forward into future projects.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working on this project has greatly improved my ability to write code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Iâ€™ve become more conscious of using descriptive variable names, consistent indentation, and adding meaningful comments to explain the logic behind my code. This attention to detail not only makes the code easier for others to understand but also simplifies future modifications.
